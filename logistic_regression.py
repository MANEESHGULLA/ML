## 1. What is Logistic Regression? (Definitions)
# Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm
# Used when output is binary (0 or 1)
# It predicts probability, not direct class

# 2. What does Logistic Regression do?
# Finds relationship between inputs and output
# Calculates probability using sigmoid function
# Converts probability into class (0 or 1)

# 3. How Logistic Regression Works
# Take input features
# Multiply by weights
# Add bias
# Pass result through sigmoid function
# Output probability (0 to 1)

# Load the dataset

# Step 2: Split the Data into Features and Target

# Step 3: Apply Standard Scaling to the Features
